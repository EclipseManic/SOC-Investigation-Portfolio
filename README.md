# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Investigation Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains structured SOC-style investigations based on packet captures, network traffic, and log analysis.  
Each case is written as a professional incident report focused on identifying suspicious activity, tracking attacker behavior, and building a clear timeline of events.

The goal is to demonstrate practical investigation and reporting skills used in real Security Operations Center (SOC) environments.
